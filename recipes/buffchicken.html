    <h4>Buffalo Chicken Dip</h4>
    <p>Buffalo Chicken dip is a great appetizer for any event, made especially around football season, but can be had at any time.</p>
    <p>This dish comes together quickly, and only needs a few ingredients. You can prep this the night before if you'd like as well.</p>

    <h5>Buffalo Chicken Dip Ingredients:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Cups Shredded Chicken (I use a rotisserie chicken, but you can use canned chicken found next to tuna)</li>
